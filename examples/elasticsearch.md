# Elasticsearch Secret Configuration Options
This benchmark will test the dynamic generation of Elasticsearch credentials. In order to use this test, configuration for the Elasticsearch instance MUST be provided as a JSON file using the `elasticsearch_db_config` flag. The primary required fields are the `username` and `password` for the user configured in Elasticsearch for Vault to use, as well as the `url` field that defines the Elasticsearch address to be used. In addition, arole configuration file can also be passed via the `elasticsearch_role_config` flag. To summarize, `elasticsearch_db_config` configures the Elasticsearch database plugin and connection, while `elasticsearch_role_config` configures the role that maps a name in Vault to a role definition in Elasticsearch.

## Test Parameters (minimum 1 required)
- `pct_elasticsearch_read`: percent of requests that are Elasticsearch Dynamic Credential generations

## Additional Parameters
- `elasticsearch_db_config` _(required)_: path to JSON file containing configuration of the Elasticsearch database plugin and connection.  Configuration options can be found in the [Elasticsearch Vault documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/databases/elasticdb).  Example configuration files can be found in the [Elasticsearch configuration directory](/configs/elasticsearch/).
- `elasticsearch_role_config`: path to a JSON file containing the Elasticsearch role configuration. This role maps a name in Vault to a role definition in Elasticsearch. If this is not specified, a default configuration will be used (see below) that creates ` my-vault-role` that has basic read permissions.

### Default Elasticsearch Role Configuration
```json
{
    "role_name": "my-vault-role",
    "creation_statements": "{\"elasticsearch_role_definition\": {\"indices\": [{\"names\":[\"*\"], \"privileges\":[\"read\"]}]}}",
    "default_ttl": "1h",
    "max_ttl": "24h"
}
```

### Example Usage

```bash
$ vault-benchmark \
    -vault_addr=http://localhost:8200 \
    -vault_token=root \
    -pct_elasticsearch_read=100 \
    -elasticsearch_role_config=elasticsearch_role_config.json \
    -elasticsearch_db_config=elasticsearch_db_config.json
