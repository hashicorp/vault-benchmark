# Consul Secret Configuration Options

This benchmark will test Consul secret engine operations. In order to use this test, configuration for the Consul server must be provided as a JSON file using the `consul_config_json` flag. The primary required field is `address` which is the address of the Consul server. Additionally, the Consul version should be in the `version` field, which is used to determine the correct API calls to make. The default version is `1.8.0`. The Consul server must be running and accessible from the Vault server.

## Test Parameters (minimum 1 required)

- `pct_consul_read`: percent of requests that are Consul Dynamic Credential generations

## Additional Parameters

- `consul_config_json` _(required)_: path to JSON file containing Vault Consul configuration.  The configuration options can be found in the [Consul Vault documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/consul#configure-connection).  Example configuration files can be found in the [Consul configuration directory](/configs/consul/).  If a `token` is not provided, Vault will attempt to auto-bootstrap the ACL system.  Once this is done, (or if you have manually bootstrapped the ACL System) the token will need to be added to the configuration file.
- `consul_role_config_json` _(required)_: path to a JSON file containing the Consul role configuration.  The configuration options can be found in the [Consul Vault documentation](https://developer.hashicorp.com/vault/api-docs/secret/consul#create-update-role).  Example configuration files can be found in the [Consul configuration directory](/configs/consul/).
